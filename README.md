# DragonDiffusion

Rawr.

This repo will soon be an unofficial implementation of "DragonDiffusion: Enabling Drag-style Manipulation on Diffusion Models" (Mou et al., 2023).

This is quite a meaty paper and there's a lot going on. I'm gonna break it down into a few notebooks â€” there are nested techniques from other papers which I need to implement first, before actually getting to DragonDiffusion.

### TODO
- [x] ~Generate masks for both a generated and a 'real' image~
- [ ] Null text inversion
- [ ] Basic Dragon Diffusion loop for one type of edit 
- [ ] Complete suite of edits
